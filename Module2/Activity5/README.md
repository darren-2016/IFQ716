# IFQ716 Module 2 - Activity 5: Make your guestbook function work with POST

Develop the guestbook form to work with POST rather than GET.

The form handling code reads the form data from the request body rather than from the URL.

Spin up the server using `npm start` and open the browser at `localhost:3000/form`.
