# IFQ716 Module 2 - Activity 4: Form handling

An HTML Form is rendered and opened via the `/form` route.

Upon clicking the **Submit** button, the action is directed to the `/add` route, where the **guestBook.json** data file is updated.

Spin up the server using `npm start`, and open the browser at `localhost:3000/form`
