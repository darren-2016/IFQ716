# Activity 1: Creating a more versatile Node server

This activity shows how to carry out real backend operations, in this case using an HTTP server that will serve the ubiquitous *'Hello World!'* message.

Our HTTP server is created using the `http.createServer` function, and is configured to listen on port 3000 of the local host.

Start the server by running the following from within the VS Code terminal : `node app.js`

# Further Steps

Since it can become tedious to have to keep running the server using the `node app.js` command, we can simplify things by using the `npm start` command.

To use this method, once must create a **package.json** file.  This is autogenerated by using the command `npm init`.  As the **package.json** is generated, press <Enter> to accept the defaults at this stage.

In the **package.json** file, add the line `"start": "node app.js"` immediately after the `"test"` line within the `"scripts":` section.

The web application can then be started using the command `npm start`.
