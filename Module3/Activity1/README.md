- Restricting whuch request method is allowed on a route

After creating the **package.json** using `npm init`, one can optionally install nodemon, which means one does not need to restart the application for each code change.

Install **nodemon** using `npm i nodemon`.

In the **package.json**, **nodemon** can then be added with the line `"start": "nodemon app.js"`.

Spin up the server using `npm start`.
